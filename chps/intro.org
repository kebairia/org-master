#+TITLE: An introduction

* Introduction     
This *package* contains a minimal, modern template for writing your autoref:fig:myfig1
thesis. While originally meant to be used for a Ph.D. thesis, you can
equally well use it for your honour thesis, bachelor thesis, and so
on---some adjustments may be necessary, though.
these are citation cite:Laramee11,Laramee10 and cite:Edelsbrunner02, cite:Edelsbrunner10
so be autocite:Tufte01
** Why?
I was not satisfied with the available templates for and wanted
to heed the style advice given by people such as Robert Bringhurst cite:Bringhurst12 or Edward R.
Tufte cite:Tufte90,Tufte01 . While there \emph{are} some packages out 
there that attempt to emulate these styles, I found them to be either
too bloated, too playful, or too constraining. This template attempts to
produce a beautiful look without having to resort to any sort of hacks.
I hope you like it cite:nikouei19:_i_safe.

** How?
The package tries to be easy to use. If you are satisfied with the
default settings, just add =\documentclass{mimosis}= at the beginning of your document.
This is sufficient to use the class.
It is possible to build your document using either  or. I personally prefer one of the latter two because they make
it easier to select proper fonts.

The template automatically imports numerous convenience packages that
aid in your typesetting process.

refer to the source code for more demonstrations.

*** Equations
Define new mathematical operators using \verb|\DeclareMathOperator|.
Some operators are already pre-defined by the template, such as the
distance between two objects. Please see the template for some examples.

Moreover, this template contains a correct differential operator. Use \verb|\diff| to typeset the differential of integrals:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equation1}
  f(u) := \int_{v \in \domain}\dist(u,v)\diff{v}
\end{equation}
You can see that, as a courtesy towards most mathematicians, this
template gives you the possibility to refer to the real numbers 
and the domain ~$\domain$ of some function. Take a look at the source for
more examples. By the way, the template comes with spacing fixes for the
automated placement of brackets.
