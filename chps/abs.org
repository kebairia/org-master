Technological advances of recent years have changed the way research is done. When de-
scribing complex phenomena, it is now possible to measure and model a myriad of diferent
aspects pertaining to them. Tis increasing number of variables, however, poses signifcant
challenges for the visual analysis and interpretation of such multivariate data. Yet, the efective
visualization of structures in multivariate data is of paramount importance for building mod-
els, forming hypotheses, and understanding intrinsic properties of the underlying phenomena.
Tis thesis provides novel visualization techniques that advance the feld of multivariate visual
data analysis by helping represent and comprehend the structure of high-dimensional data.
In contrast to approaches that focus on visualizing multivariate data directly or by means of
their geometrical features, the methods developed in this thesis focus on their topological
properties. More precisely, these methods provide structural descriptions that are driven by
persistent homology, a technique from the emerging feld of computational topology.
Such descriptions are developed in two separate parts of this thesis. Te frst part deals
with the qualitative visualization of topological features in multivariate data. It presents
novel visualization methods that directly depict topological information, thus permitting the
comparison of structural features in a qualitative manner. Te techniques described in this
part serve as low-dimensional representations that make the otherwise high-dimensional
topological features accessible. We show how to integrate them into data analysis workfows
based on clustering in order to obtain more information about the underlying data. Te
efcacy of such combined workfows is demonstrated by analysing complex multivariate data
sets from cultural heritage and political science, for example, whose structures are hidden to
common visualization techniques.
Te second part of this thesis is concerned with the quantitative visualization of topological
features. It describes novel methods that measure diferent aspects of multivariate data in
order to provide quantifable information about them. Here, the topological characteristics
serve as a feature descriptor. Using these descriptors, the visualization techniques in this part
focus on augmenting and improving existing data analysis processes. Among others, they
deal with the visualization of high-dimensional regression models, the visualization of errors
in embeddings of multivariate data, as well as the assessment and visualization of the results
of diferent clustering algorithms.
All the methods presented in this thesis are evaluated and analysed on diferent data sets in
order to show their robustness. Tis thesis demonstrates that the combination of geometrical
and topological methods may support, complement, and surpass existing approaches for
multivariate visual data analysis.
